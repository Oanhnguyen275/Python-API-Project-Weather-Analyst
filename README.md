# Python API – Weather & Hotel Data Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a Python-based dashboard that fetches real-time **weather** and **hotel/travel information** for multiple cities, processes the data, and visualizes insights to support informed travel planning.

**Key Features:**

- **Weather Data Integration** – Retrieves current weather conditions and forecasts using APIs.  
- **Hotel & Travel Information** – Fetches hotel availability, city, humidity, and other relevant metrics.  
- **Data Processing** – Cleans and transforms data with **Pandas**.  
- **Visualizations** – Generates **interactive maps** and static plots using **HvPlot/HoloViews** and **Matplotlib**.

### Quick Results Summary

Hotel Availability Insights: Cities with the highest hotel availability were identified. Correlation between Weather and Hotel Occupancy

Weather Trends Analysis: Average temperature trends over the past week/month show clear patterns. Certain cities show high variability in temperature, which may affect travel planning.

Preliminary analysis suggests a moderate correlation: higher temperatures sometimes correspond with increased hotel availability in tourist destinations.

###
The hotel map allows users to quickly identify hotel clusters and city distribution.

Users can filter by city or humidity levels to prioritize travel decisions.

### Conclusion:

The dashboard provides real-time, actionable insights for travel planning.

Visualizations make it easy to compare cities, identify trends, and plan trips effectively.
